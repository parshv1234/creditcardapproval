## 📌 Overview
This project was developed as part of my **CDC Internship** with **SmartBridge** in collaboration with **Google for Developers**.  
The objective is to predict **Credit Card Approval** using applicant and credit history data.  

It includes both:
- A **Jupyter Notebook** for exploratory analysis and model building  
- A **Flask Web Application** for user interaction  

---

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values & cleaning raw inputs  
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gaining insights from applicant data  
- 🤖 **Model Development:** Training ML models with Scikit-learn  
- ⚡ **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing performance metrics  
- 🌐 **Flask Web App:** User-friendly interface for predictions  
- 📑 **End-to-End Pipeline:** From data preprocessing to prediction  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.9+  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Framework:** Flask  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage

### 🔧 Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com//credit-card-approval.git
cd credit-card-approval
```

### 🔧 Step 2: Create & activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Linux/Mac
source venv/bin/activate
```
### 🔧 Step 3: Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 🔧 Step 4: Run the Flask application
```bash
cd Flask
python app.py
```
- 📌 Once the application is running, open your web browser and navigate to the following address:
- 👉 http://127.0.0.1:5000/

## 📊 Results & Achievements
- ✅ Achieved an **87.4/100** performance score during the final internship evaluation.

- ✅ Delivered **strong predictive accuracy on unseen applicant data**, validating the model's effectiveness.

- ✅ Developed a **fully functional Flask web application** for demonstrating the model's predictions.

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- 🌍 **Deploy the App:** Migrate the application to a cloud platform like Heroku or Render for global access.

- 📈 **Integrate Advanced Models:** Implement XGBoost & LightGBM to potentially boost predictive performance.

- 🔎 **Add Explainable AI (XAI):** Integrate libraries like SHAP or ELI5 to provide transparency and explain model predictions.

- 🔌 **Expose REST API:** Develop and expose REST API endpoints for seamless enterprise-level integration.
